# About

This page is to present some of the methodologies and features behind some of the repositories that are
too detailed for a README but also not quite rigorous/novel enough for scientific publication. Hopefully it
is useful!

Details on frc-comp-analysis can be found [here](https://matthewt303.github.io/frc_details/)
